# Payload
A simple experimental-purpose Java CLI program that simulates the following case:
Travellers at XAirlines速 often bring heavy luggage that they exceed the normal weight previuosly put by XAirlines速 officials for normal travellers, Accordingly, XAirlines速 came up with a solution of calculating how many weight units do those people exceed, and based on their extra amount of weight, they will pay an extra amount of money (price), of course this is  calculated given the price per extra weight unit, in addition to that, the price per extra weight unit changes as the traveller's class changes. Traveller's classes are:

- Premium Economy class

- Ordinary Economy Class

- Bussiness Class

- First Class


XAirlines速 is offering this program to its clients as a way to inform them of how much extra money they are paying, given the passengers' classes, and the amount of weight they are bringing.

# Support for building the project:
